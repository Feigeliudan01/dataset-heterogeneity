  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Validation of a novel gene expression signature in
                 independent data sets is a critical step in the development of
                 a clinically useful test for cancer patient
                 risk-stratification. However, validation is often unconvincing
                 because the size of the test set is typically small. To
                 overcome this problem we used publicly available breast cancer
                 gene expression data sets and a novel approach to data fusion,
                 in order to validate a new breast tumor intrinsic list.
                 RESULTS: A 105-tumor training set containing 26 sample pairs
                 was used to derive a new breast tumor intrinsic gene list.
                 This intrinsic list contained 1300 genes and a proliferation
                 signature that was not present in previous breast intrinsic
                 gene sets. We tested this list as a survival predictor on a
                 data set of 311 tumors compiled from three independent
                 microarray studies that were fused into a single data set
                 using Distance Weighted Discrimination. When the new intrinsic
                 gene set was used to hierarchically cluster this combined test
                 set, tumors were grouped into LumA, LumB, Basal-like,
                 HER2+/ER-, and Normal Breast-like tumor subtypes that we
                 demonstrated in previous datasets. These subtypes were
                 associated with significant differences in Relapse-Free and
                 Overall Survival. Multivariate Cox analysis of the combined
                 test set showed that the intrinsic subtype classifications
                 added significant prognostic information that was independent
                 of standard clinical predictors. From the combined test set,
                 we developed an objective and unchanging classifier based upon
                 five intrinsic subtype mean expression profiles (i.e.
                 centroids), which is designed for single sample predictions
                 (SSP). The SSP approach was applied to two additional
                 independent data sets and consistently predicted survival in
                 both systemically treated and untreated patient groups.
                 CONCLUSION: This study validates the ``breast tumor
                 intrinsic'' subtype classification as an objective means of
                 tumor classification that should be translated into a clinical
                 assay for further retrospective and prospective validation. In
                 addition, our method of combining existing data sets can be
                 used to robustly validate the potential clinical value of any
                 new gene expression profile.",

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Gene expression microarray experiments can
                 generate data sets with multiple missing expression values.
                 Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis
                 require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For
                 example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means
                 clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose
                 effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for
                 imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the
                 effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase
                 the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be
                 applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for
                 estimating missing data. RESULTS: We present a comparative
                 study of several methods for the estimation of missing values
                 in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three
                 methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method
                 (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row
                 average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter
                 settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the
                 robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing
                 data over the range of 1--20\% missing values. We show that
                 KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive
                 method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both
                 SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average
                 method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We
                 report results of the comparative experiments and provide
                 recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing

title = {Lung metastasis genes couple breast tumor size and metastatic spread},
abstract = {The association between large tumor size and metastatic risk in a majority of clinical cancers has led to questions as to whether these observations are causally related or whether one is simply a marker for the other. This is partly due to an uncertainty about how metastasis-promoting gene expression changes can arise in primary tumors. We investigated this question through the analysis of a previously defined "lung metastasis gene-expression signature" (LMS) that mediates experimental breast cancer metastasis selectively to the lung and is expressed by primary human breast cancer with a high risk for developing lung metastasis. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the LMS promotes primary tumor growth that enriches for LMS(+) cells, and it allows for intravasation after reaching a critical tumor size. Clinically, this corresponds to LMS(+) tumors being larger at diagnosis compared with LMS(-) tumors and to a marked rise in the incidence of metastasis after LMS(+) tumors reach 2 cm. Patients with LMS-expressing primary tumors selectively fail in the lung compared with the bone or other visceral sites and have a worse overall survival. The mechanistic linkage between metastasis gene expression, accelerated tumor growth, and likelihood of metastatic recurrence provided by the LMS may help to explain observations of prognostic gene signatures in primary cancer and how tumor growth can both lead to metastasis and be a marker for cells destined to metastasize.},

title = {Gene expression profiling in breast cancer: understanding the molecular basis of histologic grade to improve prognosis},
abstract = {Histologic grade in breast cancer provides clinically important prognostic information. However, 30%-60% of tumors are classified as histologic grade 2. This grade is associated with an intermediate risk of recurrence and is thus not informative for clinical decision making. We examined whether histologic grade was associated with gene expression profiles of breast cancers and whether such profiles could be used to improve histologic grading.We analyzed microarray data from 189 invasive breast carcinomas and from three published gene expression datasets from breast carcinomas. We identified differentially expressed genes in a training set of 64 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumor samples by comparing expression profiles between histologic grade 3 tumors and histologic grade 1 tumors and used the expression of these genes to define the gene expression grade index. Data from 597 independent tumors were used to evaluate the association between relapse-free survival and the gene expression grade index in a Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.We identified 97 genes in our training set that were associated with histologic grade; most of these genes were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In validation datasets, the gene expression grade index was strongly associated with histologic grade 1 and 3 status; however, among histologic grade 2 tumors, the index spanned the values for histologic grade 1-3 tumors. Among patients with histologic grade 2 tumors, a high gene expression grade index was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than a low gene expression grade index (hazard ratio = 3.61, 95% confidence interval = 2.25 to 5.78; P < .001, log-rank test).Gene expression grade index appeared to reclassify patients with histologic grade 2 tumors into two groups with high versus low risks of recurrence. This approach may improve the accuracy of tumor grading and thus its prognostic value.},

The aims of this study conducted by TRANSBIG were to independently validate these results and to compare the outcome with clinical risk assessment.Gene expression profiling of frozen samples from 198 N(-) systemically untreated patients was done at the Bordet Institute, blinded to clinical data and independent of Veridex. Genomic risk was defined by Veridex, blinded to clinical data. Survival analyses, done by an independent statistician, were done with the genomic risk and adjusted for the clinical risk, defined by Adjuvant! Online.The actual 5- and 10-year time to distant metastasis were 98% (88-100%) and 94% (83-98%), respectively, for the good profile group and 76% (68-82%) and 73% (65-79%), respectively, for the poor profile group. The actual 5- and 10-year overall survival were 98% (88-100%) and 87% (73-94%), respectively, for the good profile group and 84% (77-89%) and 72% (63-78%), respectively, for the poor profile group. We observed a strong time dependence of this signature, leading to an adjusted hazard ratio of 13.58 (1.85-99.63) and 8.20 (1.10-60.90) at 5 years and 5.11 (1.57-16.67) and 2.55 (1.07-6.10) at 10 years for time to distant metastasis and overall survival, respectively.This independent validation confirmed the performance of the 76-gene signature and adds to the growing evidence that gene expression signatures are of clinical relevance, especially for identifying patients at high risk of early distant metastases.},

The association of SET index and ESR1 levels with distant relapse risk was evaluated from microarrays of ER-positive breast cancer in two cohorts who received 5 years of tamoxifen alone as adjuvant endocrine therapy (n = 225 and 298, respectively), a cohort who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibition (n = 122), and two cohorts who received no adjuvant systemic therapy (n = 208 and 133, respectively).The SET index (165 genes) was significantly associated with distant relapse or death risk in both tamoxifen-treated cohorts (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.88, P = .002; and HR = 0.76, 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.93, P = .007) and in the chemo-endocrine-treated cohort (HR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.69, P = .011) independently from pathologic response to chemotherapy, but was not prognostic in two untreated cohorts. No distant relapse or death was observed after tamoxifen alone if node-negative and high SET or after chemo-endocrine therapy if intermediate or high SET.The SET index of ER-related transcription predicted survival benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy, not inherent prognosis. Prior chemotherapy seemed to enhance the efficacy of adjuvant endocrine therapy related to SET index.},

abstract = {Estrogen receptor (ER) expression and proliferative activity are established prognostic factors in breast cancer. In a search for additional prognostic motifs, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 200 tumors of patients who were not treated by systemic therapy after surgery using a discovery approach. After performing hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified coregulated genes related to the biological process of proliferation, steroid hormone receptor expression, as well as B-cell and T-cell infiltration. We calculated metagenes as a surrogate for all genes contained within a particular cluster and visualized the relative expression in relation to time to metastasis with principal component analysis. Distinct patterns led to the hypothesis of a prognostic role of the immune system in tumors with high expression of proliferation-associated genes. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the proliferation metagene showed a significant association with metastasis-free survival of the whole discovery cohort [hazard ratio (HR), 2.20; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.40-3.46]. The B-cell metagene showed additional independent prognostic information in carcinomas with high proliferative activity (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97). A prognostic influence of the B-cell metagene was independently confirmed by multivariate analysis in a first validation cohort enriched for high-grade tumors (n = 286; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98) and a second validation cohort enriched for younger patients (n = 302; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.7-0.97). Thus, we could show in three cohorts of untreated, node-negative breast cancer patients that the humoral immune system plays a pivotal role in metastasis-free survival of carcinomas of the breast.},

                 cancer deaths in women in the United States. Numerous gene
                 signatures of patient prognosis have been proposed, but
                 diverse data and methods make these difficult to compare or
                 use in a clinically meaningful way. We sought to identify
                 successful published prognostic gene signatures through
                 systematic validation using public data. METHODS: A systematic
                 review identified 14 prognostic models for late-stage ovarian
                 cancer. For each, we evaluated its 1) reimplementation as
                 described by the original study, 2) performance for prognosis
                 of overall survival in independent data, and 3) performance
                 compared with random gene signatures. We compared and ranked
                 models by validation in 10 published datasets comprising 1251
                 primarily high-grade, late-stage serous ovarian cancer
                 patients. All tests of statistical significance were
                 two-sided. RESULTS: Twelve published models had 95\%
                 confidence intervals of the C-index that did not include the
                 null value of 0.5; eight outperformed 97.5\% of signatures
                 including the same number of randomly selected genes and
                 trained on the same data. The four top-ranked models achieved
                 overall validation C-indices of 0.56 to 0.60 and shared
                 anticorrelation with expression of immune response pathways.
                 Most models demonstrated lower accuracy in new datasets than
                 in validation sets presented in their publication.
                 CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides definitive support for a
                 handful of prognostic models but also confirms that these
                 require improvement to be of clinical value. This work

                 heterogeneous, and accurate prognostic tools would help with
                 the clinical management of these patients. METHODS: We
                 developed and validated two gene expression signatures, the
                 first for predicting survival in advanced-stage, serous
                 ovarian cancer and the second for predicting debulking status.
                 We integrated 13 publicly available datasets totaling 1525
                 subjects. We trained prediction models using a meta-analysis
                 variation on the compound covariable method, tested models by
                 a ``leave-one-dataset-out'' procedure, and validated models in
                 additional independent datasets. Selected genes from the
                 debulking signature were validated by immunohistochemistry and
                 quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
                 (qRT-PCR) in two further independent cohorts of 179 and 78
                 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.
                 RESULTS: The survival signature stratified patients into high-
                 and low-risk groups (hazard ratio = 2.19; 95\% confidence
                 interval [CI] = 1.84 to 2.61) statistically significantly
                 better than the TCGA signature (P = .04). POSTN, CXCL14, FAP,
                 NUAK1, PTCH1, and TGFBR2 were validated by qRT-PCR (P < .05)
                 and POSTN, CXCL14, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were validated
                 by immunohistochemistry (P < .001) as independent predictors
                 of debulking status. The sum of immunohistochemistry
                 intensities for these three proteins provided a tool that
                 classified 92.8\% of samples correctly in high- and low-risk
                 groups for suboptimal debulking (area under the curve = 0.89;
                 95\% CI = 0.84 to 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Our survival signature
                 provides the most accurate and validated prognostic model for
                 early- and advanced-stage high-grade, serous ovarian cancer.
                 The debulking signature accurately predicts the outcome of
                 cytoreductive surgery, potentially allowing for stratification

                 the same time, these investigations have generated controversy

                 surfacing of noticeable discrepancies between the results of

                 classification models (SCMs) are gene expression-based
                 classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular
                 subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal
                 A, and luminal B). SSPs use hierarchical clustering, followed
                 by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of
                 tumor-intrinsic genes. SCMs use a mixture of Gaussian
                 distributions based on sets of genes with expression
                 specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes
                 (estrogen receptor [ER], HER2, and aurora kinase A [AURKA]).
                 The aim of this study was to compare the robustness,
                 classification concordance, and prognostic value of these
                 classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene SCM in a
                 large compendium of microarray datasets. METHODS: Thirty-six
                 publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were
                 subjected to molecular subtyping using five published
                 classifiers (three SSPs and two SCMs) and SCMGENE, the new
                 three-gene (ER, HER2, and AURKA) SCM. We used the prediction
                 strength statistic to estimate robustness of the
                 classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier
                 to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently
                 of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V
                 coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype
                 classifiers and association with clinical variables,
                 respectively. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and
                 cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value
                 of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were
                 two-sided. RESULTS: SCMs were statistically significantly more
                 robust than SSPs, with SCMGENE being the most robust because
                 of its simplicity. SCMGENE was statistically significantly
                 concordant with published SCMs (κ = 0.65-0.70) and SSPs (κ =
                 0.34-0.59), statistically significantly associated with ER (V
                 = 0.64), HER2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V =
                 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.
                 CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adequate classification
                 of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of
                 breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative
                 measurements of three key genes.",

                 Cross-validation methods are often used to obtain estimates of
                 classification accuracy, but both simulations and case studies
                 suggest that, when inappropriate methods are used, bias may
                 ensue. Bias can be bypassed and generalizability can be tested
                 by external (independent) validation. We evaluated 35 studies
                 that have reported on external validation of a molecular
                 classifier. We extracted information on study design and
                 methodological features, and compared the performance of
                 molecular classifiers in internal cross-validation versus
                 external validation for 28 studies where both had been
                 performed. We demonstrate that the majority of studies pursued
                 cross-validation practices that are likely to overestimate
                 classifier performance. Most studies were markedly
                 underpowered to detect a 20\% decrease in sensitivity or
                 specificity between internal cross-validation and external
                 validation [median power was 36\% (IQR, 21-61\%) and 29\%
                 (IQR, 15-65\%), respectively]. The median reported
                 classification performance for sensitivity and specificity was
                 94\% and 98\%, respectively, in cross-validation and 88\% and
                 81\% for independent validation. The relative diagnostic odds
                 ratio was 3.26 (95\% CI 2.04-5.21) for cross-validation versus
                 independent validation. Finally, we reviewed all studies (n =
                 758) which cited those in our study sample, and identified
                 only one instance of additional subsequent independent
                 validation of these classifiers. In conclusion, these results
                 document that many cross-validation practices employed in the
                 literature are potentially biased and genuine progress in this
                 field will require adoption of routine external validation of
                 molecular classifiers, preferably in much larger studies than
